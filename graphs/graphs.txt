 
 nodes/vertex - represents data
 
 edges - directed / undirected
 
 path- contains lot of nodes each of them are reachable
     - node cannot appeaer twice in a path
 
 Degree 
     - In undirected graphs Degree= 2 * Number of nodes
     - Directed graphs
     	- Indegree 
     	- Outdegree
     	
 Types of graphs
 
1. Undirected graphs
2. Directed graphs
3. Undirected/ Directed cyclic graphs - start from a node end to the same node
4. Undirected/ Directed Acyclic graphs - we may not able to reach the node again
5.  ""         ""       Edge weighted graphs - edge weight can be consider as a cost to travel form one node to other

 Grpahs Representation

n,m will be given as input

how we store

1. Adjacency Matrix representation
   - adj[n+1][n+1]
2. Adjacency List

 Connected Componenets

1. There exist a componenets for graphs 
   - group of graphs not connected but still they are called graphs
   - there can of n components of a single grpah
   - During traversal we reach completedly one component
   - To solve this problem we use visited array
   - By this we can reach all the components of graphs
   
   Traversal
 
1. BFS 
2. DFS
