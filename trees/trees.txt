Types of Binary Trees:
	
	1. Full tree: number of leaf node should be either 0 or 2
	2. Balanced tree: tree with n nodes shoudl have height log(n)
	3. Complete tree: All levels are filled except last it must be filled from the right to left
	4. Perfect tree: A tree in which all interior nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
	5. Degenrate tree:  binary tree where each parent node has only one child. This makes the tree essentially a linked list, reducing the efficiency of operations.
